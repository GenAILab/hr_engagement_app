   - Implement performance monitoring to identify optimization opportunities
   - Set up regular review of resource utilization

3. **S3 Lifecycle Policies**
   - Implement automated cleanup of old deployment artifacts
   - Configure transition to lower-cost storage tiers for infrequently accessed data

## Terraform Best Practices

The infrastructure for the HR Engagement Application should be managed using Terraform, following these best practices:

### 1. Variable Management

- **Centralized Variable Definitions**: Define all configurable parameters in a dedicated `variables.tf` file with clear descriptions and appropriate default values.
  ```hcl
  variable "app_name" {
    description = "The name of the application"
    type        = string
    default     = "hr-engagement-app"
  }
  
  variable "allowed_ip_addresses" {
    description = "List of IP addresses allowed to access the application"
    type        = list(string)
    default     = [
      "195.160.234.0/24",    # EU-GW
      "195.160.232.0/24",    # UA-GW
      "195.160.233.0/24"     # US-GW
    ]
  }
  ```

- **Environment-Specific Variables**: Use variable defaults for common values and override them for environment-specific settings.

- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Never store sensitive data like credentials in Terraform files. Use environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive information.

### 2. State Management with S3

- **Remote State Storage**: Store Terraform state in an S3 bucket to enable collaboration and maintain state history.
  ```hcl
  terraform {
    backend "s3" {
      bucket         = "app-builder-deployment-tf-state"
      key            = "terraform/state"
      region         = "us-east-1"
      encrypt        = true
    }
  }
  ```

- **State Encryption**: Enable encryption for the state file in the S3 bucket to protect sensitive information.

- **State Isolation**: Use different state files for different environments (dev, staging, production) by using different keys in the S3 backend.

- **State Locking Without DynamoDB**: While DynamoDB is typically used for state locking, this architecture will rely on S3's versioning capabilities to handle concurrent operations without DynamoDB.

### 3. Code Organization

- **Modular Structure**: Organize Terraform code into logical modules based on resource types or functionality.
  ```
  terraform/
  ├── main.tf           # Main configuration file
  ├── variables.tf      # Variable definitions
  ├── outputs.tf        # Output definitions
  ├── providers.tf      # Provider configurations
  ├── modules/          # Reusable modules
  │   ├── networking/   # Networking resources
  │   ├── ecs/          # ECS resources
  │   └── security/     # Security resources
  ```

- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for resources, variables, and outputs.

- **Resource Grouping**: Group related resources together in the same file or module.

### 4. Security and Access Control

- **IAM Roles with Least Privilege**: Define IAM roles with the minimum permissions required.

- **Security Group Rules**: Define explicit ingress and egress rules for security groups.

- **Resource Tagging**: Implement comprehensive tagging for all resources to improve manageability and cost tracking.
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "app_cluster" {
    name = var.app_name
    
    tags = {
      Name        = var.app_name
      Environment = var.environment
      ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
    }
  }
  ```

### 5. Version Control and CI/CD Integration

- **Version Pinning**: Pin Terraform and provider versions to ensure consistency.
  ```hcl
  terraform {
    required_version = ">= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0"
    
    required_providers {
      aws = {
        source  = "hashicorp/aws"
        version = "~> 4.0"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate Terraform with GitHub Actions for automated infrastructure deployment.

- **Plan Review**: Implement a review process for Terraform plans before applying changes.

### 6. Documentation and Comments

- **Resource Documentation**: Add comments to explain complex resource configurations.

- **Output Documentation**: Document outputs to make them more useful for other systems or team members.
  ```hcl
  output "alb_dns_name" {
    description = "The DNS name of the load balancer"
    value       = aws_lb.app_lb.dns_name
  }
  ```
