## Terraform + GitHub Actions
 As experienced Cloud Architect and DevOps, could you please implemenet infrastructure as a code with terraform with deployment of my app on AWS. Please use
  AWS_Architecture_Vision.md document as baseline that highlight AWS deployment and Terraform best practices. Please store terraform state in the s3 bucket and use this bucket
  app-builder-dplmt-tf-state.

  GitHub Actions should not contain terraform infrastructure deployment, it should be manual step. It should also include ECR Repository Creation.  But then GitHub Actions
  should build a container, push it, veryfy the deployment and prepare a summary.

  Update terraform and create a IAM user with required permission that I can use for GitHub actions execution.

please fix it Any selected backend applies to the entire configuration, so Terraform expects provider configurations only in the root module. I need to have such backend
  setup.

   please refactor terraform code to create ecr repo with pre spefied repo, so you can skip sending ecr_repository_url before applying

   ?? apply terraform plan for dev env to check

   I executed terraform and deployed infra. where outputs stored: github_actions_access_key_id and github_actions_secret_access_key

    update terraform outputs to include resource "aws_iam_user" "github_actions"ver

    An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the ListTasks operation: User: arn:aws:iam::***:user/deployment/hr-engagement-app-github-actions-dev is not authorized to perform: ecs:ListTasks on resource: arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:***:container-instance/hr-engagement-app-cluster-dev/* because no identity-based policy allows the ecs:ListTasks action
